ODM alternative
 what does odm mongoose do? Allows NodeJS(JS Objects) to speak with MongoDB(doc ,collection and DB)


Why use? Simplify validation code
	Business logic boilerplate	 
	shorter code


const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');		//new DB test

const Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', {name : String});	//new modle of how data  will be represented

const kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildijan'});		//Create new document with new model
kitty.save().then() =>console.log('meow'));		//Save model in MongoDB database


Flashback:

coding was pain in DOM model
we started adding JQuery
everything became shorter and easier

Mongoose is like Jquery for mongoDB
