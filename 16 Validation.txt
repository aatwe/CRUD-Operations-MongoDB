 Why we were using Mongoose? validation easier
no need for assert statements
we use built in validation checks


//Adding validation
//Why use validators?make dat comply with format
1) required validator for id etc
2) min max validator
	min : checks value >= min value
	max : checks value <= max value


//How to make name field required
Validation -> required	//make name field 

const fruitSchema = new mongooseSchema ({
 name: {
  type: String,
  required: [true, "Please check your data entry, no name specified"] 
}
 rating: {
		
  type: Number,	//How to limit rating 1-10
  		//Docs -> Validation -> Built in Validators 
  min: 1,
  max: 10
},
 review: String
});

const Fruit = mongoose.model("Fruit", fruitSchema);

const fruit = new Fruit ({
 name: "Apple",
 rating: 34,	//validation error as per schema	//apply wont be added after running app.js
 review: "Pretty solid as fruit"
});
const fruit = new Fruit ({
		//Please check your data entry, no name specified 
 rating: 10,	Error after runnign app.js // no name
  review: "Awesome"
});

fruit.save();
